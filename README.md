# Introduction
This package contains the Distribution Explorer application. The Distribution Explorer is a 
tool that allows users to explore the income distribution of households, families and individuals
in New Zealand, using outputs created by the Treasury's Tax and Welfare Analysis (TAWA) model.
This software was first developed by Boston Hart during the summer of 2021/22. Boston joined the 
Analytics and Insights team as part of the Analytics and Research in Government internship 
programme.

This version of the Distribution Explorer is intended as an open-source research tool, and does 
not constitute official Treasury advice. We welcome suggestions, feedback, and corrections from users.

The Distribution Explorer is a tool which can be used to understand the income distribution of households, 
families, and individuals in New Zealand. The tool allows users to explore and compare the income distribution 
for the population, and for subgroups of interest. For example, users can compare the differences between 
households with individuals aged over 65, households with and without children, and households in receipt of 
different government transfers. The tool also allows users to view how the components of income vary over the 
income distribution.

# Overview

This version of the Distribution Explorer is available at https://treasury-analytics-and-insights.github.io/DistributionExplorer/

Please note that Shinylive applications can take a long time to load on the first launch, as various packages
required by the application are installed in the background. 

# Notes

Income estimates were produced using Treasury’s Tax and Welfare Analysis (TAWA) micro-simulation model.
Income estimates will be updated periodically as new economic forecasts
and survey data become available.
