# Introduction
This package contains a preliminary version of the DistributionExplorer application. 
This software was developed by Boston Hart during the summer of 2021/22. Boston joined the 
Analytics and Insights team as part of the Analytics and Research in Government internship 
programme.

This branch contains further developments made to the tool in 2024. These developments are
preliminary, and have not undergone a full quality assurance process. This version of the
DistributionExplorer is intended as an open-source research tool, and does not constitute official 
Treasury advice. We welcome suggestions, feedback, and corrections from users.

The DistributionExplorer is a tool which can be used to understand the
income distribution of households, families, and individuals in New Zealand.

The tool allows users to explore and compare the income distribution for the population, and for
subgroups of interest. For example, users can compare the differences between households with individuals 
aged over 65, households with (and without) children, and households in receipt of different 
government transfers. The tool also allows users to view how the components of
income vary over the income distribution.

# Overview

This version of the DistributionExplorer is available at https://treasury-analytics-and-insights.github.io/DistributionExplorer/

Please note that Shinylive applications can take a long time to load on the first launch, as various packages
required by the application are installed in the background. 

# Notes

Income estimates were produced using Treasury’s micro-simulation model of the tax and 
welfare system - TAWA. Income estimates will be updated periodically as new economic forecasts
and survey data become available.
